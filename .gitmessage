# ==================== WRITE YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE BELOW ====================
# Remove the '#' from the lines below and replace with your actual message:
#
# <type>(<scope>): <subject>
#
# [optional body]
# ==================== HOW TO MAKE A GOOD COMMIT? ====================
#
# ------ MANDATORY RULES ------
# ⚠️  The commit MUST have a reference in the footer (Refs: SCRUM-XX). This should be set automatically.
# ⚠️  The subject MUST be in lowercase and MUST NOT end with a period (.)
# ⚠️  The type MUST be in lowercase
# ⚠️  The full header (type+scope+subject) has a MAX of 100 characters
#
# ------ Conventional Commits Format ------
# <type>: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
#
# <scope>: Optional. The affected module (auth, dataset, zenodo, etc.)
#
# <body>: Optional. Explain WHAT and WHY, not HOW
#
# <footer>: MANDATORY. Reference to issues
#
# ------ Valid Examples ------
# feat(dataset): add csv export functionality
#
# Refs: SCRUM-45
#
# ---
#
# fix(auth): correct password validation logic
#
# The password validator was not checking for minimum length correctly.
# This fix ensures passwords must be at least 8 characters.
#
# Refs: SCRUM-32
